## Prerequisites for the demo

To follow the demo you just need any IDE, I would recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
To display the developed app make sure to install the extenstion "[LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)", you should find it in the Visual Studio Code marketplace. The extension starts a local development server with live reload.
Just right click the ```index.html``` and select "Open with Live Server".

For this tutorial we start with a given folder structure, which already contains the basic files like ```index.html```, ```Component.js``` and ```Manifest.json``` as well as a basic view with its controller. You can find this basic project [here](demo/Start_of_Tutorial/).

For different steps of the tutorial I have pushed intermediate versions of the demo app to several branches. They are linked at the appropriate places in the tutorial
